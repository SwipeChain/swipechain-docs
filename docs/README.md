# Introduction

## What Is Swipechain?

Swipechain's goal is to give everyone the power to easily create, customize and scale their own blockchain networks. By combining innovative network design with accessible & extensible software, Swipechain allows for maximum developer productivity. We prioritize builders and doers from every walk of life by building blockchain software that balances power and ease of use.

## Navigating the Docs

Our documentation is a central hub for all knowledge Swipechain, and as such it's designed to be useful to readers of all technical backgrounds. If read from cover to cover, you'll learn everything from the basics of blockchain to how to create a blockchain of your own â€” and much more besides.

Below you can read short summaries of each chapter and the topics you'll find within them. The documentation will be edited and expanded frequently as development continues, so check back often for updates.

### [From Blockchain to Swipechain](/introduction/)

This is our introduction to the world of blockchain and Swipechain's place within it.

[_Blockchain_](/introduction/blockchain/) is a good place to begin if you have little prior experience with blockchain. It answers many common questions about what blockchain is, why it's useful, and how Swipechain helps make blockchain easier.
The [_SWIPECHAIN_](/introduction/swipechain/) section highlights the philosophy behind the Swipechain blockchain, and how that compares against some of the sector's most popular projects (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)

### [The Swipechain Guidebook](/guidebook/)

In this section, we describe the software components of the Swipechain. We focus in particular on Swipechain Core: the codebase powering the nodes that, in turn, power the Swipechain network.

[_Core_](/guidebook/core/) describes the architecture of Swipechain Core. At present, the documentation focuses on the packages that allow for easy application and blockchain customization.
[_Contribution Guidelines_](/guidebook/contribution-guidelines/) details the process for contributing to Swipechain software. Reading this section also helps to understand the coding styles and practices that inform development across the Ecosystem.
[_Guides_](/guidebook/guides/) offers software-specific information on how to develop for Swipechain. From running your first test suite to submitting pull requests for your code's inclusion into Swipechain itself, this is the section to read if you're a developer looking to get involved.

### [The Swipechain Tutorials](/tutorials/)

The counterpart to the Guidebook, the tutorials contain practical code snippets and guides to help developers write productive code with the Swipechain as quickly as possible. We'll always provide context for the code we post here, so you'll have the convenience of copy-and-paste and the knowledge to strike your own path when necessary.

[_Deployer_](/tutorials/deployer/) is the place to go for code snippets and tutorials related to building your own blockchain. We cover setting up your blockchain and deploying it to major cloud hosting service providers.
[_Exchanges_](/tutorials/node/setup) is where developers for cryptocurrency exchanges can find information on how to integrate the Swipechain coin into their platforms. Though we cannot make any guarantees about the codebases of any projects besides the Swipechain coin, this recipe should serve as a good starting point for integrating Swipechain BridgeChain coins as well.
[_IoT_](/tutorials/iot/) provides guidance on anything from setting up your Swipechain IoT development environment to storing and reacting to data on the Swipechain blockchain using platforms like Arduino and PlatformIO.

### [Swipechain Cryptography](/cryptography/)

This section provides details and insights into the cryptographic identities of the Swipechain blockchain. It covers topics such as PrivateKeys, PublicKeys, and Signatures; as well as the hashing and encoding methods used by Swipechain.


### [Swipechain API](/api/)

This section describes the structure of all Swipechain APIs, as well as usage examples. After you've read the Guidebook and tutorials, this section should be the first place you turn to find out how to interact with the Swipechain software.

[_Public API_](/api/public/) describes the API that's accessible through any Swipechain node. API references for Swipechain v3 are included.
The [_SDK_](/sdk/) section includes information on how to use any of the Swipechain API wrappers we've written for supercharged development in your language of choice. Currently, the following SDKs are available:

- Java
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Python


[_P2P_](/api/p2p/) outlines the functions available to the P2P API.

[_JSON-RPC_](/api/json-rpc/) contains instructions on how to use the JSON-RPC API to interact with the Swipechain blockchain. This technology is of particular interest to exchanges looking to use a Bitcoin RPC-like interface to integrate Swipechain into their platform.

[_Webhooks_](/api/webhooks/) describes how to use the webhooks feature of Swipechain v3 to "listen" to events on the Swipechain blockchain. This is especially useful for developers who are looking to drive action in their applications in response to specific blockchain events (transactions, vote, etc.)

### [FAQ](/faq/)

We answer some of the most common questions about Swipechain here, from general questions about Swipechain philosophy to specific tips on how to resolve commonly encountered errors.
